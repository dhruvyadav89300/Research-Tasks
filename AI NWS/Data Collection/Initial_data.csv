.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Arctic cold continues in the short term with dangerous wind chills this
  morning and hard freezes both mornings.

- Extreme Cold Warning is in effect for the northern Rio Grande, Edwards
  Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and Coastal Plains. Cold
  Weather Advisory is in effect for the southern Rio Grande and
  Winter Garden. These remain in effect through Noon CST today.

- Potential for very light freezing drizzle Friday afternoon.

Arctic high pressure remains in control. The strongest surface
pressure gradient is this morning with northerly winds of 10 to 15
mph and gusts up to 25 mph. These winds combined with temperatures
in the teens and 20s create wind chills of Zero to 5 Edwards Plateau
and Hill Country, 5 to 10 I-35 corridor to the Coastal Plains, and
10 to 20 Winter Garden. The Extreme Cold Warning for the northern
Rio Grande, Edwards Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and
Coastal Plains and the Cold Weather Advisory for the southern Rio
Grande and Winter Garden continue through Noon CST today. A warmer
day is expected as cloudiness will not be as extensive with
temperatures and wind chills rising out of criteria levels. As an
upper level trough approaches from the west, a surface trough forms
off the Texas coast tonight into Friday. Warm, moist advection
develops tonight leading to strengthening isentropic forcing on
Friday. Extensive cloudiness returns tonight into Friday with patchy
precipitation developing by the afternoon. Low temperatures tonight
will be warmer due to the cloudiness, though still mostly below
freezing. High temperatures on Friday will be colder again due to
the cloudiness and wet bulb effects as the precipitation develops.
The precipitation becomes focused mainly along the I-35 corridor as
the lower levels saturate there sooner. Forecast soundings indicate
it would be drizzle or freezing drizzle. Any amounts would be very
light and should not cause any impacts.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday night through Wednesday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Low chance for freezing rain for the Hill Country and I-35 Friday night
  into Saturday morning.

- Showers over the Coastal Plains Saturday through Sunday morning.

- Warm trend Sunday through the middle of next week.

By Friday night, a slow-moving surface trough is forecast to lie
just off the South Texas coast. Aloft, an amplifying upper-level
disturbance over the southwestern US is expected to support the
development of a 30 kt southerly low level jet at 850mb, funneling
moisture from the coastal disturbance into our area. This will
enhance the ascent of air atop initially dense and somewhat dry cold
air near the surface. A low stratiform cloud deck will cover much of
the region and model soundings show this cloud deck thickening
through the night as the air beneath the cloud gradually moistens
with more precipitation eventually reaching the ground. Currently,
guidance suggests the western flanks of the main axis of moisture
transport Friday night into Saturday morning may extend into the I-
35 corridor and the Hill Country where overnight temperatures are
currently forecast to bottom out around 28 to 33 degrees. Thus, the
rate of this low-level moistening will be pivotal in determining
precipitation type and coverage. Mean SREF ensemble soundings show
an above-freezing warm nose over most of the cloud deck aloft, but
within about 2000 ft of the ground, evaporative cooling could
introduce conditions more conducive to freezing rain. The latest
LREF ensemble indicated that the most likely overlap of subfreezing
wet bulb temperatures and precipitation was over the Hill Country
near the I-35 corridor early Saturday morning. Some of the higher
resolution mesoscale models, which tend to outperform coarser models
in these setups, are starting to get in range of this potential
event and are also hinting at this freezing rain potential Friday
night and Saturday morning. Acknowledging this guidance and given
their better handling of previous events, I have increased the area
of possible freezing rain over parts of the Hill Country and I-35
corridor north of Bexar County, though overall PoPs are still only
around 30 percent. We will continue to monitor mesoscale trends as
this potential event moves into the short-range.

Precipitation rates Saturday morning, either freezing or liquid,
should be generally light given the shallow depth of cloud (below
about 750mb) and modest ascent. Temperatures should get into the 40s
Saturday afternoon, so precipitation types should eventually be all
liquid. Ongoing shower activity primarily over the Coastal Plains
may strengthen and grow in coverage some Saturday afternoon onwards
as a shortwave trough approaches. This shortwave has trended slower
in the latest guidance, so rain showers look to persist over the
Coastal Plains into Sunday morning. Current guidance suggests
rainfall totals generally on the order of a few tenths of an inch
over the weekend, but there may be locally heavier totals especially
along and east of Highway 77 if some more elevated instability
materializes. Shower activity will generally shift eastwards with
time in tandem with the shortwave.

Lows Sunday morning are currently forecast to be in the upper 30s
throughout South Central Texas. By Sunday afternoon, the
aforementioned shortwave trough should be east of our area. This
will have the effect of both moving the coastal disturbance eastward
and introducing a dry, mid-level northwesterly flow. This will cause
clouds to clear west to east and set up a string of sunny and
warming afternoons. Lingering clouds Sunday may still result in a
west-to-east contrast in highs with upper-50s along Highway 77 to
the lower 70s along the Rio Grande. The warming trend looks to
continue to midweek with highs in the 70s and 80s and lows in the
40s and 50s through Wednesday. A distant shortwave trough could
bring a dry cold front Wednesday or Thursday next week.

.AVIATION...
(06Z TAFS)
Issued at 1104 PM CST Wed Feb 19 2025

Evening winds have settled for the most part but a few random gusts
to 20 knots will probably occur through midday Thursday. A round of
MVFR CIGs continue to work south over I-35. The return to VFR at AUS
should occur near or shortly after the valid period begins, and then
SAT/SSF should see improvements by around 08Z. Skies should remain
VFR for the rest of the period.

Key Messages:

- Low chance for freezing rain for the Hill Country and I-35 Friday night

- Showers over the Coastal Plains Saturday through Sunday morning.

- Warm trend Sunday through the middle of next week.

By Friday night, a slow-moving surface trough is forecast to lie
just off the South Texas coast. Aloft, an amplifying upper-level
disturbance over the southwestern US is expected to support the
development of a 30 kt southerly low level jet at 850mb, funneling
moisture from the coastal disturbance into our area. This will

along and east of Highway 77 if some more elevated instability
materializes. Shower activity will generally shift eastwards with
time in tandem with the shortwave.

Lows Sunday morning are currently forecast to be in the upper 30s
throughout South Central Texas. By Sunday afternoon, the
aforementioned shortwave trough should be east of our area. This
will have the effect of both moving the coastal disturbance eastward
and introducing a dry, mid-level northwesterly flow. This will cause
clouds to clear west to east and set up a string of sunny and
warming afternoons. Lingering clouds Sunday may still result in a
west-to-east contrast in highs with upper-50s along Highway 77 to
the lower 70s along the Rio Grande. The warming trend looks to
continue to midweek with highs in the 70s and 80s and lows in the
40s and 50s through Wednesday. A distant shortwave trough could
bring a dry cold front Wednesday or Thursday next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Arctic cold continues in the short term with dangerous wind chills this
  morning and hard freezes both mornings.

- Extreme Cold Warning is in effect for the northern Rio Grande, Edwards
  Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and Coastal Plains. Cold
  Weather Advisory is in effect for the southern Rio Grande and
  Winter Garden. These remain in effect through Noon CST today.

- Potential for very light freezing drizzle Friday afternoon.

Arctic high pressure remains in control. The strongest surface
pressure gradient is this morning with northerly winds of 10 to 15
mph and gusts up to 25 mph. These winds combined with temperatures
in the teens and 20s create wind chills of Zero to 5 Edwards Plateau
and Hill Country, 5 to 10 I-35 corridor to the Coastal Plains, and
10 to 20 Winter Garden. The Extreme Cold Warning for the northern
Rio Grande, Edwards Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and
Coastal Plains and the Cold Weather Advisory for the southern Rio
Grande and Winter Garden continue through Noon CST today. A warmer
day is expected as cloudiness will not be as extensive with
temperatures and wind chills rising out of criteria levels. As an
upper level trough approaches from the west, a surface trough forms
off the Texas coast tonight into Friday. Warm, moist advection
develops tonight leading to strengthening isentropic forcing on
Friday. Extensive cloudiness returns tonight into Friday with patchy
precipitation developing by the afternoon. Low temperatures tonight
will be warmer due to the cloudiness, though still mostly below
freezing. High temperatures on Friday will be colder again due to
the cloudiness and wet bulb effects as the precipitation develops.
The precipitation becomes focused mainly along the I-35 corridor as
the lower levels saturate there sooner. Forecast soundings indicate
it would be drizzle or freezing drizzle. Any amounts would be very
light and should not cause any impacts.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday night through Wednesday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Low chance for freezing rain for the Hill Country and I-35 Friday night
  into Saturday morning.

- Showers over the Coastal Plains Saturday through Sunday morning.

- Warm trend Sunday through the middle of next week.

By Friday night, a slow-moving surface trough is forecast to lie
just off the South Texas coast. Aloft, an amplifying upper-level
disturbance over the southwestern US is expected to support the
development of a 30 kt southerly low level jet at 850mb, funneling
moisture from the coastal disturbance into our area. This will
enhance the ascent of air atop initially dense and somewhat dry cold
air near the surface. A low stratiform cloud deck will cover much of
the region and model soundings show this cloud deck thickening
through the night as the air beneath the cloud gradually moistens
with more precipitation eventually reaching the ground. Currently,
guidance suggests the western flanks of the main axis of moisture
transport Friday night into Saturday morning may extend into the I-
35 corridor and the Hill Country where overnight temperatures are
currently forecast to bottom out around 28 to 33 degrees. Thus, the
rate of this low-level moistening will be pivotal in determining
precipitation type and coverage. Mean SREF ensemble soundings show
an above-freezing warm nose over most of the cloud deck aloft, but
within about 2000 ft of the ground, evaporative cooling could
introduce conditions more conducive to freezing rain. The latest
LREF ensemble indicated that the most likely overlap of subfreezing
wet bulb temperatures and precipitation was over the Hill Country
near the I-35 corridor early Saturday morning. Some of the higher
resolution mesoscale models, which tend to outperform coarser models
in these setups, are starting to get in range of this potential
event and are also hinting at this freezing rain potential Friday
night and Saturday morning. Acknowledging this guidance and given
their better handling of previous events, I have increased the area
of possible freezing rain over parts of the Hill Country and I-35
corridor north of Bexar County, though overall PoPs are still only
around 30 percent. We will continue to monitor mesoscale trends as
this potential event moves into the short-range.

Precipitation rates Saturday morning, either freezing or liquid,
should be generally light given the shallow depth of cloud (below
about 750mb) and modest ascent. Temperatures should get into the 40s
Saturday afternoon, so precipitation types should eventually be all
liquid. Ongoing shower activity primarily over the Coastal Plains
may strengthen and grow in coverage some Saturday afternoon onwards
as a shortwave trough approaches. This shortwave has trended slower
in the latest guidance, so rain showers look to persist over the
Coastal Plains into Sunday morning. Current guidance suggests
rainfall totals generally on the order of a few tenths of an inch
over the weekend, but there may be locally heavier totals especially
along and east of Highway 77 if some more elevated instability
materializes. Shower activity will generally shift eastwards with
time in tandem with the shortwave.

Lows Sunday morning are currently forecast to be in the upper 30s
throughout South Central Texas. By Sunday afternoon, the

- Potential for very light freezing drizzle Friday afternoon.

Arctic high pressure remains in control. The strongest surface
pressure gradient is this morning with northerly winds of 10 to 15
mph and gusts up to 25 mph. These winds combined with temperatures
in the teens and 20s create wind chills of Zero to 5 Edwards Plateau
and Hill Country, 5 to 10 I-35 corridor to the Coastal Plains, and
10 to 20 Winter Garden. The Extreme Cold Warning for the northern
Rio Grande, Edwards Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and
Coastal Plains and the Cold Weather Advisory for the southern Rio
Grande and Winter Garden continue through Noon CST today. A warmer
day is expected as cloudiness will not be as extensive with
temperatures and wind chills rising out of criteria levels. As an
upper level trough approaches from the west, a surface trough forms
off the Texas coast tonight into Friday. Warm, moist advection
develops tonight leading to strengthening isentropic forcing on
Friday. Extensive cloudiness returns tonight into Friday with patchy
precipitation developing by the afternoon. Low temperatures tonight
will be warmer due to the cloudiness, though still mostly below
freezing. High temperatures on Friday will be colder again due to
the cloudiness and wet bulb effects as the precipitation develops.
The precipitation becomes focused mainly along the I-35 corridor as
the lower levels saturate there sooner. Forecast soundings indicate
it would be drizzle or freezing drizzle. Any amounts would be very
light and should not cause any impacts.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday night through Wednesday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Low chance for freezing rain for the Hill Country and I-35 Friday night
  into Saturday morning.

- Showers over the Coastal Plains Saturday through Sunday morning.

- Warm trend Sunday through the middle of next week.

By Friday night, a slow-moving surface trough is forecast to lie
just off the South Texas coast. Aloft, an amplifying upper-level
disturbance over the southwestern US is expected to support the
development of a 30 kt southerly low level jet at 850mb, funneling
moisture from the coastal disturbance into our area. This will
enhance the ascent of air atop initially dense and somewhat dry cold
air near the surface. A low stratiform cloud deck will cover much of
the region and model soundings show this cloud deck thickening
through the night as the air beneath the cloud gradually moistens
with more precipitation eventually reaching the ground. Currently,
guidance suggests the western flanks of the main axis of moisture
transport Friday night into Saturday morning may extend into the I-
35 corridor and the Hill Country where overnight temperatures are
currently forecast to bottom out around 28 to 33 degrees. Thus, the
rate of this low-level moistening will be pivotal in determining
precipitation type and coverage. Mean SREF ensemble soundings show
an above-freezing warm nose over most of the cloud deck aloft, but
within about 2000 ft of the ground, evaporative cooling could
introduce conditions more conducive to freezing rain. The latest
LREF ensemble indicated that the most likely overlap of subfreezing
wet bulb temperatures and precipitation was over the Hill Country
near the I-35 corridor early Saturday morning. Some of the higher
resolution mesoscale models, which tend to outperform coarser models
in these setups, are starting to get in range of this potential
event and are also hinting at this freezing rain potential Friday
night and Saturday morning. Acknowledging this guidance and given
their better handling of previous events, I have increased the area
of possible freezing rain over parts of the Hill Country and I-35
corridor north of Bexar County, though overall PoPs are still only
around 30 percent. We will continue to monitor mesoscale trends as
this potential event moves into the short-range.

Precipitation rates Saturday morning, either freezing or liquid,
should be generally light given the shallow depth of cloud (below
about 750mb) and modest ascent. Temperatures should get into the 40s
Saturday afternoon, so precipitation types should eventually be all
liquid. Ongoing shower activity primarily over the Coastal Plains
may strengthen and grow in coverage some Saturday afternoon onwards
as a shortwave trough approaches. This shortwave has trended slower
in the latest guidance, so rain showers look to persist over the
Coastal Plains into Sunday morning. Current guidance suggests
rainfall totals generally on the order of a few tenths of an inch
over the weekend, but there may be locally heavier totals especially
along and east of Highway 77 if some more elevated instability
materializes. Shower activity will generally shift eastwards with
time in tandem with the shortwave.

Lows Sunday morning are currently forecast to be in the upper 30s
throughout South Central Texas. By Sunday afternoon, the
aforementioned shortwave trough should be east of our area. This
will have the effect of both moving the coastal disturbance eastward
and introducing a dry, mid-level northwesterly flow. This will cause
clouds to clear west to east and set up a string of sunny and
warming afternoons. Lingering clouds Sunday may still result in a
west-to-east contrast in highs with upper-50s along Highway 77 to
the lower 70s along the Rio Grande. The warming trend looks to
continue to midweek with highs in the 70s and 80s and lows in the
40s and 50s through Wednesday. A distant shortwave trough could
bring a dry cold front Wednesday or Thursday next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Arctic cold continues in the short term with dangerous wind chills this
  morning and hard freezes both mornings.

- Extreme Cold Warning is in effect for the northern Rio Grande, Edwards
  Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and Coastal Plains. Cold
  Weather Advisory is in effect for the southern Rio Grande and
  Winter Garden. These remain in effect through Noon CST today.

- Potential for very light freezing drizzle Friday afternoon.

Arctic high pressure remains in control. The strongest surface
pressure gradient is this morning with northerly winds of 10 to 15
mph and gusts up to 25 mph. These winds combined with temperatures
in the teens and 20s create wind chills of Zero to 5 Edwards Plateau
and Hill Country, 5 to 10 I-35 corridor to the Coastal Plains, and
10 to 20 Winter Garden. The Extreme Cold Warning for the northern
Rio Grande, Edwards Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and
Coastal Plains and the Cold Weather Advisory for the southern Rio
Grande and Winter Garden continue through Noon CST today. A warmer
day is expected as cloudiness will not be as extensive with
temperatures and wind chills rising out of criteria levels. As an
upper level trough approaches from the west, a surface trough forms
off the Texas coast tonight into Friday. Warm, moist advection
develops tonight leading to strengthening isentropic forcing on
Friday. Extensive cloudiness returns tonight into Friday with patchy
precipitation developing by the afternoon. Low temperatures tonight
will be warmer due to the cloudiness, though still mostly below
freezing. High temperatures on Friday will be colder again due to
the cloudiness and wet bulb effects as the precipitation develops.
The precipitation becomes focused mainly along the I-35 corridor as
the lower levels saturate there sooner. Forecast soundings indicate
it would be drizzle or freezing drizzle. Any amounts would be very
light and should not cause any impacts.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday night through Wednesday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Low chance for freezing rain for the Hill Country and I-35 Friday night
  into Saturday morning.

- Showers over the Coastal Plains Saturday through Sunday morning.

- Warm trend Sunday through the middle of next week.

By Friday night, a slow-moving surface trough is forecast to lie
just off the South Texas coast. Aloft, an amplifying upper-level
disturbance over the southwestern US is expected to support the
development of a 30 kt southerly low level jet at 850mb, funneling
moisture from the coastal disturbance into our area. This will
enhance the ascent of air atop initially dense and somewhat dry cold
air near the surface. A low stratiform cloud deck will cover much of
the region and model soundings show this cloud deck thickening
through the night as the air beneath the cloud gradually moistens
with more precipitation eventually reaching the ground. Currently,
guidance suggests the western flanks of the main axis of moisture
transport Friday night into Saturday morning may extend into the I-
35 corridor and the Hill Country where overnight temperatures are
currently forecast to bottom out around 28 to 33 degrees. Thus, the
rate of this low-level moistening will be pivotal in determining
precipitation type and coverage. Mean SREF ensemble soundings show
an above-freezing warm nose over most of the cloud deck aloft, but
within about 2000 ft of the ground, evaporative cooling could
introduce conditions more conducive to freezing rain. The latest
LREF ensemble indicated that the most likely overlap of subfreezing
wet bulb temperatures and precipitation was over the Hill Country
near the I-35 corridor early Saturday morning. Some of the higher
resolution mesoscale models, which tend to outperform coarser models
in these setups, are starting to get in range of this potential
event and are also hinting at this freezing rain potential Friday
night and Saturday morning. Acknowledging this guidance and given
their better handling of previous events, I have increased the area
of possible freezing rain over parts of the Hill Country and I-35
corridor north of Bexar County, though overall PoPs are still only
around 30 percent. We will continue to monitor mesoscale trends as
this potential event moves into the short-range.

Precipitation rates Saturday morning, either freezing or liquid,
should be generally light given the shallow depth of cloud (below
about 750mb) and modest ascent. Temperatures should get into the 40s
Saturday afternoon, so precipitation types should eventually be all
liquid. Ongoing shower activity primarily over the Coastal Plains
may strengthen and grow in coverage some Saturday afternoon onwards
as a shortwave trough approaches. This shortwave has trended slower
in the latest guidance, so rain showers look to persist over the
Coastal Plains into Sunday morning. Current guidance suggests
rainfall totals generally on the order of a few tenths of an inch
over the weekend, but there may be locally heavier totals especially
along and east of Highway 77 if some more elevated instability
materializes. Shower activity will generally shift eastwards with
time in tandem with the shortwave.

Lows Sunday morning are currently forecast to be in the upper 30s
throughout South Central Texas. By Sunday afternoon, the
aforementioned shortwave trough should be east of our area. This
will have the effect of both moving the coastal disturbance eastward
and introducing a dry, mid-level northwesterly flow. This will cause
clouds to clear west to east and set up a string of sunny and
warming afternoons. Lingering clouds Sunday may still result in a
west-to-east contrast in highs with upper-50s along Highway 77 to
the lower 70s along the Rio Grande. The warming trend looks to
continue to midweek with highs in the 70s and 80s and lows in the
40s and 50s through Wednesday. A distant shortwave trough could
bring a dry cold front Wednesday or Thursday next week.

Grande and Winter Garden continue through Noon CST today. A warmer
day is expected as cloudiness will not be as extensive with
temperatures and wind chills rising out of criteria levels. As an
upper level trough approaches from the west, a surface trough forms
off the Texas coast tonight into Friday. Warm, moist advection
develops tonight leading to strengthening isentropic forcing on
Friday. Extensive cloudiness returns tonight into Friday with patchy
precipitation developing by the afternoon. Low temperatures tonight
will be warmer due to the cloudiness, though still mostly below
freezing. High temperatures on Friday will be colder again due to
the cloudiness and wet bulb effects as the precipitation develops.
The precipitation becomes focused mainly along the I-35 corridor as
the lower levels saturate there sooner. Forecast soundings indicate
it would be drizzle or freezing drizzle. Any amounts would be very
light and should not cause any impacts.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday night through Wednesday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Low chance for freezing rain for the Hill Country and I-35 Friday night
  into Saturday morning.

- Showers over the Coastal Plains Saturday through Sunday morning.

- Warm trend Sunday through the middle of next week.

By Friday night, a slow-moving surface trough is forecast to lie
just off the South Texas coast. Aloft, an amplifying upper-level
disturbance over the southwestern US is expected to support the
development of a 30 kt southerly low level jet at 850mb, funneling
moisture from the coastal disturbance into our area. This will
enhance the ascent of air atop initially dense and somewhat dry cold
air near the surface. A low stratiform cloud deck will cover much of
the region and model soundings show this cloud deck thickening
through the night as the air beneath the cloud gradually moistens
with more precipitation eventually reaching the ground. Currently,
guidance suggests the western flanks of the main axis of moisture
transport Friday night into Saturday morning may extend into the I-
35 corridor and the Hill Country where overnight temperatures are
currently forecast to bottom out around 28 to 33 degrees. Thus, the
rate of this low-level moistening will be pivotal in determining
precipitation type and coverage. Mean SREF ensemble soundings show
an above-freezing warm nose over most of the cloud deck aloft, but
within about 2000 ft of the ground, evaporative cooling could
introduce conditions more conducive to freezing rain. The latest
LREF ensemble indicated that the most likely overlap of subfreezing
wet bulb temperatures and precipitation was over the Hill Country
near the I-35 corridor early Saturday morning. Some of the higher
resolution mesoscale models, which tend to outperform coarser models
in these setups, are starting to get in range of this potential
event and are also hinting at this freezing rain potential Friday
night and Saturday morning. Acknowledging this guidance and given
their better handling of previous events, I have increased the area
of possible freezing rain over parts of the Hill Country and I-35
corridor north of Bexar County, though overall PoPs are still only
around 30 percent. We will continue to monitor mesoscale trends as
this potential event moves into the short-range.

Precipitation rates Saturday morning, either freezing or liquid,
should be generally light given the shallow depth of cloud (below
about 750mb) and modest ascent. Temperatures should get into the 40s
Saturday afternoon, so precipitation types should eventually be all
liquid. Ongoing shower activity primarily over the Coastal Plains
may strengthen and grow in coverage some Saturday afternoon onwards
as a shortwave trough approaches. This shortwave has trended slower
in the latest guidance, so rain showers look to persist over the
Coastal Plains into Sunday morning. Current guidance suggests
rainfall totals generally on the order of a few tenths of an inch
over the weekend, but there may be locally heavier totals especially
along and east of Highway 77 if some more elevated instability
materializes. Shower activity will generally shift eastwards with
time in tandem with the shortwave.

Lows Sunday morning are currently forecast to be in the upper 30s
throughout South Central Texas. By Sunday afternoon, the
aforementioned shortwave trough should be east of our area. This
will have the effect of both moving the coastal disturbance eastward
and introducing a dry, mid-level northwesterly flow. This will cause
clouds to clear west to east and set up a string of sunny and
warming afternoons. Lingering clouds Sunday may still result in a
west-to-east contrast in highs with upper-50s along Highway 77 to
the lower 70s along the Rio Grande. The warming trend looks to
continue to midweek with highs in the 70s and 80s and lows in the
40s and 50s through Wednesday. A distant shortwave trough could
bring a dry cold front Wednesday or Thursday next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Arctic cold continues in the short term with dangerous wind chills this
  morning and hard freezes both mornings.

- Extreme Cold Warning is in effect for the northern Rio Grande, Edwards
  Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and Coastal Plains. Cold
  Weather Advisory is in effect for the southern Rio Grande and
  Winter Garden. These remain in effect through Noon CST today.

- Potential for very light freezing drizzle Friday afternoon.

Arctic high pressure remains in control. The strongest surface
pressure gradient is this morning with northerly winds of 10 to 15
mph and gusts up to 25 mph. These winds combined with temperatures
in the teens and 20s create wind chills of Zero to 5 Edwards Plateau
and Hill Country, 5 to 10 I-35 corridor to the Coastal Plains, and
10 to 20 Winter Garden. The Extreme Cold Warning for the northern
Rio Grande, Edwards Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and
Coastal Plains and the Cold Weather Advisory for the southern Rio
Grande and Winter Garden continue through Noon CST today. A warmer
day is expected as cloudiness will not be as extensive with
temperatures and wind chills rising out of criteria levels. As an
upper level trough approaches from the west, a surface trough forms
off the Texas coast tonight into Friday. Warm, moist advection
develops tonight leading to strengthening isentropic forcing on
Friday. Extensive cloudiness returns tonight into Friday with patchy
precipitation developing by the afternoon. Low temperatures tonight
will be warmer due to the cloudiness, though still mostly below
freezing. High temperatures on Friday will be colder again due to
the cloudiness and wet bulb effects as the precipitation develops.
The precipitation becomes focused mainly along the I-35 corridor as
the lower levels saturate there sooner. Forecast soundings indicate
it would be drizzle or freezing drizzle. Any amounts would be very
light and should not cause any impacts.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday night through Wednesday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Low chance for freezing rain for the Hill Country and I-35 Friday night
  into Saturday morning.

- Showers over the Coastal Plains Saturday through Sunday morning.

- Warm trend Sunday through the middle of next week.

By Friday night, a slow-moving surface trough is forecast to lie
just off the South Texas coast. Aloft, an amplifying upper-level
disturbance over the southwestern US is expected to support the
development of a 30 kt southerly low level jet at 850mb, funneling
moisture from the coastal disturbance into our area. This will
enhance the ascent of air atop initially dense and somewhat dry cold
air near the surface. A low stratiform cloud deck will cover much of
the region and model soundings show this cloud deck thickening
through the night as the air beneath the cloud gradually moistens
with more precipitation eventually reaching the ground. Currently,
guidance suggests the western flanks of the main axis of moisture
transport Friday night into Saturday morning may extend into the I-
35 corridor and the Hill Country where overnight temperatures are
currently forecast to bottom out around 28 to 33 degrees. Thus, the
rate of this low-level moistening will be pivotal in determining
precipitation type and coverage. Mean SREF ensemble soundings show
an above-freezing warm nose over most of the cloud deck aloft, but
within about 2000 ft of the ground, evaporative cooling could
introduce conditions more conducive to freezing rain. The latest
LREF ensemble indicated that the most likely overlap of subfreezing
wet bulb temperatures and precipitation was over the Hill Country
near the I-35 corridor early Saturday morning. Some of the higher
resolution mesoscale models, which tend to outperform coarser models
in these setups, are starting to get in range of this potential
event and are also hinting at this freezing rain potential Friday
night and Saturday morning. Acknowledging this guidance and given
their better handling of previous events, I have increased the area
of possible freezing rain over parts of the Hill Country and I-35
corridor north of Bexar County, though overall PoPs are still only
around 30 percent. We will continue to monitor mesoscale trends as
this potential event moves into the short-range.

Precipitation rates Saturday morning, either freezing or liquid,
should be generally light given the shallow depth of cloud (below
about 750mb) and modest ascent. Temperatures should get into the 40s
Saturday afternoon, so precipitation types should eventually be all
liquid. Ongoing shower activity primarily over the Coastal Plains
may strengthen and grow in coverage some Saturday afternoon onwards
as a shortwave trough approaches. This shortwave has trended slower
in the latest guidance, so rain showers look to persist over the
Coastal Plains into Sunday morning. Current guidance suggests
rainfall totals generally on the order of a few tenths of an inch
over the weekend, but there may be locally heavier totals especially
along and east of Highway 77 if some more elevated instability
materializes. Shower activity will generally shift eastwards with
time in tandem with the shortwave.

Lows Sunday morning are currently forecast to be in the upper 30s
throughout South Central Texas. By Sunday afternoon, the
aforementioned shortwave trough should be east of our area. This
will have the effect of both moving the coastal disturbance eastward
and introducing a dry, mid-level northwesterly flow. This will cause
clouds to clear west to east and set up a string of sunny and
warming afternoons. Lingering clouds Sunday may still result in a
west-to-east contrast in highs with upper-50s along Highway 77 to
the lower 70s along the Rio Grande. The warming trend looks to
continue to midweek with highs in the 70s and 80s and lows in the
40s and 50s through Wednesday. A distant shortwave trough could
bring a dry cold front Wednesday or Thursday next week.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday night through Wednesday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Low chance for freezing rain for the Hill Country and I-35 Friday night
  into Saturday morning.

- Showers over the Coastal Plains Saturday through Sunday morning.

- Warm trend Sunday through the middle of next week.

By Friday night, a slow-moving surface trough is forecast to lie
just off the South Texas coast. Aloft, an amplifying upper-level
disturbance over the southwestern US is expected to support the
development of a 30 kt southerly low level jet at 850mb, funneling
moisture from the coastal disturbance into our area. This will
enhance the ascent of air atop initially dense and somewhat dry cold
air near the surface. A low stratiform cloud deck will cover much of
the region and model soundings show this cloud deck thickening
through the night as the air beneath the cloud gradually moistens
with more precipitation eventually reaching the ground. Currently,
guidance suggests the western flanks of the main axis of moisture
transport Friday night into Saturday morning may extend into the I-
35 corridor and the Hill Country where overnight temperatures are
currently forecast to bottom out around 28 to 33 degrees. Thus, the
rate of this low-level moistening will be pivotal in determining
precipitation type and coverage. Mean SREF ensemble soundings show
an above-freezing warm nose over most of the cloud deck aloft, but
within about 2000 ft of the ground, evaporative cooling could
introduce conditions more conducive to freezing rain. The latest
LREF ensemble indicated that the most likely overlap of subfreezing
wet bulb temperatures and precipitation was over the Hill Country
near the I-35 corridor early Saturday morning. Some of the higher
resolution mesoscale models, which tend to outperform coarser models
in these setups, are starting to get in range of this potential
event and are also hinting at this freezing rain potential Friday
night and Saturday morning. Acknowledging this guidance and given
their better handling of previous events, I have increased the area
of possible freezing rain over parts of the Hill Country and I-35
corridor north of Bexar County, though overall PoPs are still only
around 30 percent. We will continue to monitor mesoscale trends as
this potential event moves into the short-range.

Precipitation rates Saturday morning, either freezing or liquid,
should be generally light given the shallow depth of cloud (below
about 750mb) and modest ascent. Temperatures should get into the 40s
Saturday afternoon, so precipitation types should eventually be all
liquid. Ongoing shower activity primarily over the Coastal Plains
may strengthen and grow in coverage some Saturday afternoon onwards
as a shortwave trough approaches. This shortwave has trended slower
in the latest guidance, so rain showers look to persist over the
Coastal Plains into Sunday morning. Current guidance suggests
rainfall totals generally on the order of a few tenths of an inch
over the weekend, but there may be locally heavier totals especially
along and east of Highway 77 if some more elevated instability
materializes. Shower activity will generally shift eastwards with
time in tandem with the shortwave.

Lows Sunday morning are currently forecast to be in the upper 30s
throughout South Central Texas. By Sunday afternoon, the
aforementioned shortwave trough should be east of our area. This
will have the effect of both moving the coastal disturbance eastward
and introducing a dry, mid-level northwesterly flow. This will cause
clouds to clear west to east and set up a string of sunny and
warming afternoons. Lingering clouds Sunday may still result in a
west-to-east contrast in highs with upper-50s along Highway 77 to
the lower 70s along the Rio Grande. The warming trend looks to
continue to midweek with highs in the 70s and 80s and lows in the
40s and 50s through Wednesday. A distant shortwave trough could
bring a dry cold front Wednesday or Thursday next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Arctic cold continues in the short term with dangerous wind chills this
  morning and hard freezes both mornings.

- Extreme Cold Warning is in effect for the northern Rio Grande, Edwards
  Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and Coastal Plains. Cold
  Weather Advisory is in effect for the southern Rio Grande and
  Winter Garden. These remain in effect through Noon CST today.

- Potential for very light freezing drizzle Friday afternoon.

Arctic high pressure remains in control. The strongest surface
pressure gradient is this morning with northerly winds of 10 to 15
mph and gusts up to 25 mph. These winds combined with temperatures
in the teens and 20s create wind chills of Zero to 5 Edwards Plateau
and Hill Country, 5 to 10 I-35 corridor to the Coastal Plains, and
10 to 20 Winter Garden. The Extreme Cold Warning for the northern
Rio Grande, Edwards Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and
Coastal Plains and the Cold Weather Advisory for the southern Rio
Grande and Winter Garden continue through Noon CST today. A warmer
day is expected as cloudiness will not be as extensive with
temperatures and wind chills rising out of criteria levels. As an
upper level trough approaches from the west, a surface trough forms
off the Texas coast tonight into Friday. Warm, moist advection
develops tonight leading to strengthening isentropic forcing on
Friday. Extensive cloudiness returns tonight into Friday with patchy
precipitation developing by the afternoon. Low temperatures tonight
will be warmer due to the cloudiness, though still mostly below
freezing. High temperatures on Friday will be colder again due to
the cloudiness and wet bulb effects as the precipitation develops.
The precipitation becomes focused mainly along the I-35 corridor as

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Arctic cold continues in the short term with dangerous wind chills this
  morning and hard freezes both mornings.

- Extreme Cold Warning is in effect for the northern Rio Grande, Edwards
  Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and Coastal Plains. Cold
  Weather Advisory is in effect for the southern Rio Grande and
  Winter Garden. These remain in effect through Noon CST today.

- Potential for very light freezing drizzle Friday afternoon.

Arctic high pressure remains in control. The strongest surface
pressure gradient is this morning with northerly winds of 10 to 15
mph and gusts up to 25 mph. These winds combined with temperatures
in the teens and 20s create wind chills of Zero to 5 Edwards Plateau
and Hill Country, 5 to 10 I-35 corridor to the Coastal Plains, and
10 to 20 Winter Garden. The Extreme Cold Warning for the northern
Rio Grande, Edwards Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and
Coastal Plains and the Cold Weather Advisory for the southern Rio
Grande and Winter Garden continue through Noon CST today. A warmer
day is expected as cloudiness will not be as extensive with
temperatures and wind chills rising out of criteria levels. As an
upper level trough approaches from the west, a surface trough forms
off the Texas coast tonight into Friday. Warm, moist advection
develops tonight leading to strengthening isentropic forcing on
Friday. Extensive cloudiness returns tonight into Friday with patchy
precipitation developing by the afternoon. Low temperatures tonight
will be warmer due to the cloudiness, though still mostly below
freezing. High temperatures on Friday will be colder again due to
the cloudiness and wet bulb effects as the precipitation develops.
The precipitation becomes focused mainly along the I-35 corridor as
the lower levels saturate there sooner. Forecast soundings indicate
it would be drizzle or freezing drizzle. Any amounts would be very
light and should not cause any impacts.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday night through Wednesday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Low chance for freezing rain for the Hill Country and I-35 Friday night
  into Saturday morning.

- Showers over the Coastal Plains Saturday through Sunday morning.

- Warm trend Sunday through the middle of next week.

By Friday night, a slow-moving surface trough is forecast to lie
just off the South Texas coast. Aloft, an amplifying upper-level
disturbance over the southwestern US is expected to support the
development of a 30 kt southerly low level jet at 850mb, funneling
moisture from the coastal disturbance into our area. This will
enhance the ascent of air atop initially dense and somewhat dry cold
air near the surface. A low stratiform cloud deck will cover much of
the region and model soundings show this cloud deck thickening
through the night as the air beneath the cloud gradually moistens
with more precipitation eventually reaching the ground. Currently,
guidance suggests the western flanks of the main axis of moisture
transport Friday night into Saturday morning may extend into the I-
35 corridor and the Hill Country where overnight temperatures are
currently forecast to bottom out around 28 to 33 degrees. Thus, the
rate of this low-level moistening will be pivotal in determining
precipitation type and coverage. Mean SREF ensemble soundings show
an above-freezing warm nose over most of the cloud deck aloft, but
within about 2000 ft of the ground, evaporative cooling could
introduce conditions more conducive to freezing rain. The latest
LREF ensemble indicated that the most likely overlap of subfreezing
wet bulb temperatures and precipitation was over the Hill Country
near the I-35 corridor early Saturday morning. Some of the higher
resolution mesoscale models, which tend to outperform coarser models
in these setups, are starting to get in range of this potential
event and are also hinting at this freezing rain potential Friday
night and Saturday morning. Acknowledging this guidance and given
their better handling of previous events, I have increased the area
of possible freezing rain over parts of the Hill Country and I-35
corridor north of Bexar County, though overall PoPs are still only
around 30 percent. We will continue to monitor mesoscale trends as
this potential event moves into the short-range.

Precipitation rates Saturday morning, either freezing or liquid,
should be generally light given the shallow depth of cloud (below
about 750mb) and modest ascent. Temperatures should get into the 40s
Saturday afternoon, so precipitation types should eventually be all
liquid. Ongoing shower activity primarily over the Coastal Plains
may strengthen and grow in coverage some Saturday afternoon onwards
as a shortwave trough approaches. This shortwave has trended slower
in the latest guidance, so rain showers look to persist over the
Coastal Plains into Sunday morning. Current guidance suggests
rainfall totals generally on the order of a few tenths of an inch
over the weekend, but there may be locally heavier totals especially
along and east of Highway 77 if some more elevated instability
materializes. Shower activity will generally shift eastwards with
time in tandem with the shortwave.

Lows Sunday morning are currently forecast to be in the upper 30s
throughout South Central Texas. By Sunday afternoon, the
aforementioned shortwave trough should be east of our area. This
will have the effect of both moving the coastal disturbance eastward
and introducing a dry, mid-level northwesterly flow. This will cause
clouds to clear west to east and set up a string of sunny and
warming afternoons. Lingering clouds Sunday may still result in a
west-to-east contrast in highs with upper-50s along Highway 77 to
the lower 70s along the Rio Grande. The warming trend looks to
continue to midweek with highs in the 70s and 80s and lows in the
40s and 50s through Wednesday. A distant shortwave trough could
bring a dry cold front Wednesday or Thursday next week.

.AVIATION...
(06Z TAFS)
Issued at 1104 PM CST Wed Feb 19 2025

Evening winds have settled for the most part but a few random gusts
to 20 knots will probably occur through midday Thursday. A round of
MVFR CIGs continue to work south over I-35. The return to VFR at AUS
should occur near or shortly after the valid period begins, and then
SAT/SSF should see improvements by around 08Z. Skies should remain
VFR for the rest of the period.

- Low chance for freezing rain for the Hill Country and I-35 Friday night
  into Saturday morning.

- Showers over the Coastal Plains Saturday through Sunday morning.

- Warm trend Sunday through the middle of next week.

By Friday night, a slow-moving surface trough is forecast to lie
just off the South Texas coast. Aloft, an amplifying upper-level
disturbance over the southwestern US is expected to support the
development of a 30 kt southerly low level jet at 850mb, funneling
moisture from the coastal disturbance into our area. This will
enhance the ascent of air atop initially dense and somewhat dry cold
air near the surface. A low stratiform cloud deck will cover much of
the region and model soundings show this cloud deck thickening
through the night as the air beneath the cloud gradually moistens
with more precipitation eventually reaching the ground. Currently,
guidance suggests the western flanks of the main axis of moisture
transport Friday night into Saturday morning may extend into the I-
35 corridor and the Hill Country where overnight temperatures are
currently forecast to bottom out around 28 to 33 degrees. Thus, the
rate of this low-level moistening will be pivotal in determining
precipitation type and coverage. Mean SREF ensemble soundings show
an above-freezing warm nose over most of the cloud deck aloft, but
within about 2000 ft of the ground, evaporative cooling could
introduce conditions more conducive to freezing rain. The latest
LREF ensemble indicated that the most likely overlap of subfreezing
wet bulb temperatures and precipitation was over the Hill Country
near the I-35 corridor early Saturday morning. Some of the higher
resolution mesoscale models, which tend to outperform coarser models
in these setups, are starting to get in range of this potential
event and are also hinting at this freezing rain potential Friday
night and Saturday morning. Acknowledging this guidance and given
their better handling of previous events, I have increased the area
of possible freezing rain over parts of the Hill Country and I-35
corridor north of Bexar County, though overall PoPs are still only
around 30 percent. We will continue to monitor mesoscale trends as
this potential event moves into the short-range.

Precipitation rates Saturday morning, either freezing or liquid,
should be generally light given the shallow depth of cloud (below
about 750mb) and modest ascent. Temperatures should get into the 40s
Saturday afternoon, so precipitation types should eventually be all
liquid. Ongoing shower activity primarily over the Coastal Plains
may strengthen and grow in coverage some Saturday afternoon onwards
as a shortwave trough approaches. This shortwave has trended slower
in the latest guidance, so rain showers look to persist over the
Coastal Plains into Sunday morning. Current guidance suggests
rainfall totals generally on the order of a few tenths of an inch
over the weekend, but there may be locally heavier totals especially
along and east of Highway 77 if some more elevated instability
materializes. Shower activity will generally shift eastwards with
time in tandem with the shortwave.

Lows Sunday morning are currently forecast to be in the upper 30s
throughout South Central Texas. By Sunday afternoon, the
aforementioned shortwave trough should be east of our area. This
will have the effect of both moving the coastal disturbance eastward
and introducing a dry, mid-level northwesterly flow. This will cause
clouds to clear west to east and set up a string of sunny and
warming afternoons. Lingering clouds Sunday may still result in a
west-to-east contrast in highs with upper-50s along Highway 77 to
the lower 70s along the Rio Grande. The warming trend looks to
continue to midweek with highs in the 70s and 80s and lows in the
40s and 50s through Wednesday. A distant shortwave trough could
bring a dry cold front Wednesday or Thursday next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Arctic cold continues in the short term with dangerous wind chills this
  morning and hard freezes both mornings.

- Extreme Cold Warning is in effect for the northern Rio Grande, Edwards
  Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and Coastal Plains. Cold
  Weather Advisory is in effect for the southern Rio Grande and
  Winter Garden. These remain in effect through Noon CST today.

- Potential for very light freezing drizzle Friday afternoon.

Arctic high pressure remains in control. The strongest surface
pressure gradient is this morning with northerly winds of 10 to 15
mph and gusts up to 25 mph. These winds combined with temperatures
in the teens and 20s create wind chills of Zero to 5 Edwards Plateau
and Hill Country, 5 to 10 I-35 corridor to the Coastal Plains, and
10 to 20 Winter Garden. The Extreme Cold Warning for the northern
Rio Grande, Edwards Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and
Coastal Plains and the Cold Weather Advisory for the southern Rio
Grande and Winter Garden continue through Noon CST today. A warmer
day is expected as cloudiness will not be as extensive with
temperatures and wind chills rising out of criteria levels. As an
upper level trough approaches from the west, a surface trough forms
off the Texas coast tonight into Friday. Warm, moist advection
develops tonight leading to strengthening isentropic forcing on
Friday. Extensive cloudiness returns tonight into Friday with patchy
precipitation developing by the afternoon. Low temperatures tonight
will be warmer due to the cloudiness, though still mostly below
freezing. High temperatures on Friday will be colder again due to
the cloudiness and wet bulb effects as the precipitation develops.
The precipitation becomes focused mainly along the I-35 corridor as
the lower levels saturate there sooner. Forecast soundings indicate
it would be drizzle or freezing drizzle. Any amounts would be very
light and should not cause any impacts.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Arctic cold continues in the short term with dangerous wind chills this
  morning and hard freezes both mornings.

- Extreme Cold Warning is in effect for the northern Rio Grande, Edwards
  Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and Coastal Plains. Cold
  Weather Advisory is in effect for the southern Rio Grande and
  Winter Garden. These remain in effect through Noon CST today.

- Potential for very light freezing drizzle Friday afternoon.

Arctic high pressure remains in control. The strongest surface
pressure gradient is this morning with northerly winds of 10 to 15
mph and gusts up to 25 mph. These winds combined with temperatures
in the teens and 20s create wind chills of Zero to 5 Edwards Plateau
and Hill Country, 5 to 10 I-35 corridor to the Coastal Plains, and
10 to 20 Winter Garden. The Extreme Cold Warning for the northern
Rio Grande, Edwards Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and
Coastal Plains and the Cold Weather Advisory for the southern Rio
Grande and Winter Garden continue through Noon CST today. A warmer
day is expected as cloudiness will not be as extensive with
temperatures and wind chills rising out of criteria levels. As an
upper level trough approaches from the west, a surface trough forms
off the Texas coast tonight into Friday. Warm, moist advection
develops tonight leading to strengthening isentropic forcing on
Friday. Extensive cloudiness returns tonight into Friday with patchy
precipitation developing by the afternoon. Low temperatures tonight
will be warmer due to the cloudiness, though still mostly below
freezing. High temperatures on Friday will be colder again due to
the cloudiness and wet bulb effects as the precipitation develops.
The precipitation becomes focused mainly along the I-35 corridor as
the lower levels saturate there sooner. Forecast soundings indicate
it would be drizzle or freezing drizzle. Any amounts would be very
light and should not cause any impacts.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday night through Wednesday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Low chance for freezing rain for the Hill Country and I-35 Friday night
  into Saturday morning.

- Showers over the Coastal Plains Saturday through Sunday morning.

- Warm trend Sunday through the middle of next week.

By Friday night, a slow-moving surface trough is forecast to lie
just off the South Texas coast. Aloft, an amplifying upper-level
disturbance over the southwestern US is expected to support the
development of a 30 kt southerly low level jet at 850mb, funneling
moisture from the coastal disturbance into our area. This will
enhance the ascent of air atop initially dense and somewhat dry cold
air near the surface. A low stratiform cloud deck will cover much of
the region and model soundings show this cloud deck thickening
through the night as the air beneath the cloud gradually moistens
with more precipitation eventually reaching the ground. Currently,
guidance suggests the western flanks of the main axis of moisture
transport Friday night into Saturday morning may extend into the I-
35 corridor and the Hill Country where overnight temperatures are
currently forecast to bottom out around 28 to 33 degrees. Thus, the
rate of this low-level moistening will be pivotal in determining
precipitation type and coverage. Mean SREF ensemble soundings show
an above-freezing warm nose over most of the cloud deck aloft, but
within about 2000 ft of the ground, evaporative cooling could
introduce conditions more conducive to freezing rain. The latest
LREF ensemble indicated that the most likely overlap of subfreezing
wet bulb temperatures and precipitation was over the Hill Country
near the I-35 corridor early Saturday morning. Some of the higher
resolution mesoscale models, which tend to outperform coarser models
in these setups, are starting to get in range of this potential
event and are also hinting at this freezing rain potential Friday
night and Saturday morning. Acknowledging this guidance and given
their better handling of previous events, I have increased the area
of possible freezing rain over parts of the Hill Country and I-35
corridor north of Bexar County, though overall PoPs are still only
around 30 percent. We will continue to monitor mesoscale trends as
this potential event moves into the short-range.

Precipitation rates Saturday morning, either freezing or liquid,
should be generally light given the shallow depth of cloud (below
about 750mb) and modest ascent. Temperatures should get into the 40s
Saturday afternoon, so precipitation types should eventually be all
liquid. Ongoing shower activity primarily over the Coastal Plains
may strengthen and grow in coverage some Saturday afternoon onwards
as a shortwave trough approaches. This shortwave has trended slower
in the latest guidance, so rain showers look to persist over the
Coastal Plains into Sunday morning. Current guidance suggests
rainfall totals generally on the order of a few tenths of an inch
over the weekend, but there may be locally heavier totals especially
along and east of Highway 77 if some more elevated instability
materializes. Shower activity will generally shift eastwards with
time in tandem with the shortwave.

Lows Sunday morning are currently forecast to be in the upper 30s
throughout South Central Texas. By Sunday afternoon, the
aforementioned shortwave trough should be east of our area. This
will have the effect of both moving the coastal disturbance eastward
and introducing a dry, mid-level northwesterly flow. This will cause
clouds to clear west to east and set up a string of sunny and
warming afternoons. Lingering clouds Sunday may still result in a
west-to-east contrast in highs with upper-50s along Highway 77 to
the lower 70s along the Rio Grande. The warming trend looks to
continue to midweek with highs in the 70s and 80s and lows in the
40s and 50s through Wednesday. A distant shortwave trough could
bring a dry cold front Wednesday or Thursday next week.

.AVIATION...

Issued at 1104 PM CST Wed Feb 19 2025

Evening winds have settled for the most part but a few random gusts
to 20 knots will probably occur through midday Thursday. A round of
MVFR CIGs continue to work south over I-35. The return to VFR at AUS
should occur near or shortly after the valid period begins, and then
SAT/SSF should see improvements by around 08Z. Skies should remain
VFR for the rest of the period.

development of a 30 kt southerly low level jet at 850mb, funneling
moisture from the coastal disturbance into our area. This will
enhance the ascent of air atop initially dense and somewhat dry cold
air near the surface. A low stratiform cloud deck will cover much of
the region and model soundings show this cloud deck thickening
through the night as the air beneath the cloud gradually moistens
with more precipitation eventually reaching the ground. Currently,
guidance suggests the western flanks of the main axis of moisture
transport Friday night into Saturday morning may extend into the I-
35 corridor and the Hill Country where overnight temperatures are
currently forecast to bottom out around 28 to 33 degrees. Thus, the
rate of this low-level moistening will be pivotal in determining
precipitation type and coverage. Mean SREF ensemble soundings show
an above-freezing warm nose over most of the cloud deck aloft, but
within about 2000 ft of the ground, evaporative cooling could
introduce conditions more conducive to freezing rain. The latest
LREF ensemble indicated that the most likely overlap of subfreezing
wet bulb temperatures and precipitation was over the Hill Country
near the I-35 corridor early Saturday morning. Some of the higher
resolution mesoscale models, which tend to outperform coarser models
in these setups, are starting to get in range of this potential
event and are also hinting at this freezing rain potential Friday
night and Saturday morning. Acknowledging this guidance and given
their better handling of previous events, I have increased the area
of possible freezing rain over parts of the Hill Country and I-35
corridor north of Bexar County, though overall PoPs are still only
around 30 percent. We will continue to monitor mesoscale trends as
this potential event moves into the short-range.

Precipitation rates Saturday morning, either freezing or liquid,
should be generally light given the shallow depth of cloud (below
about 750mb) and modest ascent. Temperatures should get into the 40s
Saturday afternoon, so precipitation types should eventually be all
liquid. Ongoing shower activity primarily over the Coastal Plains
may strengthen and grow in coverage some Saturday afternoon onwards
as a shortwave trough approaches. This shortwave has trended slower
in the latest guidance, so rain showers look to persist over the
Coastal Plains into Sunday morning. Current guidance suggests
rainfall totals generally on the order of a few tenths of an inch
over the weekend, but there may be locally heavier totals especially
along and east of Highway 77 if some more elevated instability
materializes. Shower activity will generally shift eastwards with
time in tandem with the shortwave.

Lows Sunday morning are currently forecast to be in the upper 30s
throughout South Central Texas. By Sunday afternoon, the
aforementioned shortwave trough should be east of our area. This
will have the effect of both moving the coastal disturbance eastward
and introducing a dry, mid-level northwesterly flow. This will cause
clouds to clear west to east and set up a string of sunny and
warming afternoons. Lingering clouds Sunday may still result in a
west-to-east contrast in highs with upper-50s along Highway 77 to
the lower 70s along the Rio Grande. The warming trend looks to
continue to midweek with highs in the 70s and 80s and lows in the
40s and 50s through Wednesday. A distant shortwave trough could
bring a dry cold front Wednesday or Thursday next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Arctic cold continues in the short term with dangerous wind chills this
  morning and hard freezes both mornings.

- Extreme Cold Warning is in effect for the northern Rio Grande, Edwards
  Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and Coastal Plains. Cold
  Weather Advisory is in effect for the southern Rio Grande and
  Winter Garden. These remain in effect through Noon CST today.

- Potential for very light freezing drizzle Friday afternoon.

Arctic high pressure remains in control. The strongest surface
pressure gradient is this morning with northerly winds of 10 to 15
mph and gusts up to 25 mph. These winds combined with temperatures
in the teens and 20s create wind chills of Zero to 5 Edwards Plateau
and Hill Country, 5 to 10 I-35 corridor to the Coastal Plains, and
10 to 20 Winter Garden. The Extreme Cold Warning for the northern
Rio Grande, Edwards Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and
Coastal Plains and the Cold Weather Advisory for the southern Rio
Grande and Winter Garden continue through Noon CST today. A warmer
day is expected as cloudiness will not be as extensive with
temperatures and wind chills rising out of criteria levels. As an
upper level trough approaches from the west, a surface trough forms
off the Texas coast tonight into Friday. Warm, moist advection
develops tonight leading to strengthening isentropic forcing on
Friday. Extensive cloudiness returns tonight into Friday with patchy
precipitation developing by the afternoon. Low temperatures tonight
will be warmer due to the cloudiness, though still mostly below
freezing. High temperatures on Friday will be colder again due to
the cloudiness and wet bulb effects as the precipitation develops.
The precipitation becomes focused mainly along the I-35 corridor as
the lower levels saturate there sooner. Forecast soundings indicate
it would be drizzle or freezing drizzle. Any amounts would be very
light and should not cause any impacts.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Arctic cold continues in the short term with dangerous wind chills this
  morning and hard freezes both mornings.

- Extreme Cold Warning is in effect for the northern Rio Grande, Edwards
  Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and Coastal Plains. Cold
  Weather Advisory is in effect for the southern Rio Grande and
  Winter Garden. These remain in effect through Noon CST today.

- Potential for very light freezing drizzle Friday afternoon.

Arctic high pressure remains in control. The strongest surface
pressure gradient is this morning with northerly winds of 10 to 15
mph and gusts up to 25 mph. These winds combined with temperatures
in the teens and 20s create wind chills of Zero to 5 Edwards Plateau
and Hill Country, 5 to 10 I-35 corridor to the Coastal Plains, and
10 to 20 Winter Garden. The Extreme Cold Warning for the northern
Rio Grande, Edwards Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and
Coastal Plains and the Cold Weather Advisory for the southern Rio
Grande and Winter Garden continue through Noon CST today. A warmer
day is expected as cloudiness will not be as extensive with
temperatures and wind chills rising out of criteria levels. As an
upper level trough approaches from the west, a surface trough forms
off the Texas coast tonight into Friday. Warm, moist advection
develops tonight leading to strengthening isentropic forcing on
Friday. Extensive cloudiness returns tonight into Friday with patchy
precipitation developing by the afternoon. Low temperatures tonight
will be warmer due to the cloudiness, though still mostly below
freezing. High temperatures on Friday will be colder again due to
the cloudiness and wet bulb effects as the precipitation develops.
The precipitation becomes focused mainly along the I-35 corridor as
the lower levels saturate there sooner. Forecast soundings indicate
it would be drizzle or freezing drizzle. Any amounts would be very
light and should not cause any impacts.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday night through Wednesday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Low chance for freezing rain for the Hill Country and I-35 Friday night
  into Saturday morning.

- Showers over the Coastal Plains Saturday through Sunday morning.

- Warm trend Sunday through the middle of next week.

By Friday night, a slow-moving surface trough is forecast to lie
just off the South Texas coast. Aloft, an amplifying upper-level
disturbance over the southwestern US is expected to support the
development of a 30 kt southerly low level jet at 850mb, funneling
moisture from the coastal disturbance into our area. This will
enhance the ascent of air atop initially dense and somewhat dry cold
air near the surface. A low stratiform cloud deck will cover much of
the region and model soundings show this cloud deck thickening
through the night as the air beneath the cloud gradually moistens
with more precipitation eventually reaching the ground. Currently,
guidance suggests the western flanks of the main axis of moisture
transport Friday night into Saturday morning may extend into the I-
35 corridor and the Hill Country where overnight temperatures are
currently forecast to bottom out around 28 to 33 degrees. Thus, the
rate of this low-level moistening will be pivotal in determining
precipitation type and coverage. Mean SREF ensemble soundings show
an above-freezing warm nose over most of the cloud deck aloft, but
within about 2000 ft of the ground, evaporative cooling could
introduce conditions more conducive to freezing rain. The latest
LREF ensemble indicated that the most likely overlap of subfreezing
wet bulb temperatures and precipitation was over the Hill Country
near the I-35 corridor early Saturday morning. Some of the higher
resolution mesoscale models, which tend to outperform coarser models
in these setups, are starting to get in range of this potential
event and are also hinting at this freezing rain potential Friday
night and Saturday morning. Acknowledging this guidance and given
their better handling of previous events, I have increased the area
of possible freezing rain over parts of the Hill Country and I-35
corridor north of Bexar County, though overall PoPs are still only
around 30 percent. We will continue to monitor mesoscale trends as
this potential event moves into the short-range.

Precipitation rates Saturday morning, either freezing or liquid,
should be generally light given the shallow depth of cloud (below
about 750mb) and modest ascent. Temperatures should get into the 40s
Saturday afternoon, so precipitation types should eventually be all
liquid. Ongoing shower activity primarily over the Coastal Plains
may strengthen and grow in coverage some Saturday afternoon onwards
as a shortwave trough approaches. This shortwave has trended slower
in the latest guidance, so rain showers look to persist over the
Coastal Plains into Sunday morning. Current guidance suggests
rainfall totals generally on the order of a few tenths of an inch
over the weekend, but there may be locally heavier totals especially
along and east of Highway 77 if some more elevated instability
materializes. Shower activity will generally shift eastwards with
time in tandem with the shortwave.

Lows Sunday morning are currently forecast to be in the upper 30s
throughout South Central Texas. By Sunday afternoon, the
aforementioned shortwave trough should be east of our area. This
will have the effect of both moving the coastal disturbance eastward
and introducing a dry, mid-level northwesterly flow. This will cause
clouds to clear west to east and set up a string of sunny and
warming afternoons. Lingering clouds Sunday may still result in a
west-to-east contrast in highs with upper-50s along Highway 77 to
the lower 70s along the Rio Grande. The warming trend looks to
continue to midweek with highs in the 70s and 80s and lows in the
40s and 50s through Wednesday. A distant shortwave trough could
bring a dry cold front Wednesday or Thursday next week.

.AVIATION...

Issued at 1104 PM CST Wed Feb 19 2025

Evening winds have settled for the most part but a few random gusts
to 20 knots will probably occur through midday Thursday. A round of
MVFR CIGs continue to work south over I-35. The return to VFR at AUS
should occur near or shortly after the valid period begins, and then
SAT/SSF should see improvements by around 08Z. Skies should remain
VFR for the rest of the period.

guidance suggests the western flanks of the main axis of moisture
transport Friday night into Saturday morning may extend into the I-
35 corridor and the Hill Country where overnight temperatures are
currently forecast to bottom out around 28 to 33 degrees. Thus, the
rate of this low-level moistening will be pivotal in determining
precipitation type and coverage. Mean SREF ensemble soundings show
an above-freezing warm nose over most of the cloud deck aloft, but
within about 2000 ft of the ground, evaporative cooling could
introduce conditions more conducive to freezing rain. The latest
LREF ensemble indicated that the most likely overlap of subfreezing
wet bulb temperatures and precipitation was over the Hill Country
near the I-35 corridor early Saturday morning. Some of the higher
resolution mesoscale models, which tend to outperform coarser models
in these setups, are starting to get in range of this potential
event and are also hinting at this freezing rain potential Friday
night and Saturday morning. Acknowledging this guidance and given
their better handling of previous events, I have increased the area
of possible freezing rain over parts of the Hill Country and I-35
corridor north of Bexar County, though overall PoPs are still only
around 30 percent. We will continue to monitor mesoscale trends as
this potential event moves into the short-range.

Precipitation rates Saturday morning, either freezing or liquid,
should be generally light given the shallow depth of cloud (below
about 750mb) and modest ascent. Temperatures should get into the 40s
Saturday afternoon, so precipitation types should eventually be all
liquid. Ongoing shower activity primarily over the Coastal Plains
may strengthen and grow in coverage some Saturday afternoon onwards
as a shortwave trough approaches. This shortwave has trended slower
in the latest guidance, so rain showers look to persist over the
Coastal Plains into Sunday morning. Current guidance suggests
rainfall totals generally on the order of a few tenths of an inch
over the weekend, but there may be locally heavier totals especially
along and east of Highway 77 if some more elevated instability
materializes. Shower activity will generally shift eastwards with
time in tandem with the shortwave.

Lows Sunday morning are currently forecast to be in the upper 30s
throughout South Central Texas. By Sunday afternoon, the
aforementioned shortwave trough should be east of our area. This
will have the effect of both moving the coastal disturbance eastward
and introducing a dry, mid-level northwesterly flow. This will cause
clouds to clear west to east and set up a string of sunny and
warming afternoons. Lingering clouds Sunday may still result in a
west-to-east contrast in highs with upper-50s along Highway 77 to
the lower 70s along the Rio Grande. The warming trend looks to
continue to midweek with highs in the 70s and 80s and lows in the
40s and 50s through Wednesday. A distant shortwave trough could
bring a dry cold front Wednesday or Thursday next week.

Issued at 1104 PM CST Wed Feb 19 2025

Evening winds have settled for the most part but a few random gusts
to 20 knots will probably occur through midday Thursday. A round of
MVFR CIGs continue to work south over I-35. The return to VFR at AUS
should occur near or shortly after the valid period begins, and then
SAT/SSF should see improvements by around 08Z. Skies should remain
VFR for the rest of the period.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Friday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Arctic cold continues in the short term with dangerous wind chills this
  morning and hard freezes both mornings.

- Extreme Cold Warning is in effect for the northern Rio Grande, Edwards
  Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and Coastal Plains. Cold
  Weather Advisory is in effect for the southern Rio Grande and
  Winter Garden. These remain in effect through Noon CST today.

- Potential for very light freezing drizzle Friday afternoon.

Arctic high pressure remains in control. The strongest surface
pressure gradient is this morning with northerly winds of 10 to 15
mph and gusts up to 25 mph. These winds combined with temperatures
in the teens and 20s create wind chills of Zero to 5 Edwards Plateau
and Hill Country, 5 to 10 I-35 corridor to the Coastal Plains, and
10 to 20 Winter Garden. The Extreme Cold Warning for the northern
Rio Grande, Edwards Plateau, Hill Country, I-35 corridor, and
Coastal Plains and the Cold Weather Advisory for the southern Rio
Grande and Winter Garden continue through Noon CST today. A warmer
day is expected as cloudiness will not be as extensive with
temperatures and wind chills rising out of criteria levels. As an
upper level trough approaches from the west, a surface trough forms
off the Texas coast tonight into Friday. Warm, moist advection
develops tonight leading to strengthening isentropic forcing on
Friday. Extensive cloudiness returns tonight into Friday with patchy
precipitation developing by the afternoon. Low temperatures tonight
will be warmer due to the cloudiness, though still mostly below
freezing. High temperatures on Friday will be colder again due to
the cloudiness and wet bulb effects as the precipitation develops.
The precipitation becomes focused mainly along the I-35 corridor as
the lower levels saturate there sooner. Forecast soundings indicate
it would be drizzle or freezing drizzle. Any amounts would be very
light and should not cause any impacts.

.LONG TERM...
(Friday night through Wednesday)
Issued at 155 AM CST Thu Feb 20 2025

Key Messages:

- Low chance for freezing rain for the Hill Country and I-35 Friday night
  into Saturday morning.

- Showers over the Coastal Plains Saturday through Sunday morning.

- Warm trend Sunday through the middle of next week.

By Friday night, a slow-moving surface trough is forecast to lie
just off the South Texas coast. Aloft, an amplifying upper-level
disturbance over the southwestern US is expected to support the
development of a 30 kt southerly low level jet at 850mb, funneling
moisture from the coastal disturbance into our area. This will
enhance the ascent of air atop initially dense and somewhat dry cold
air near the surface. A low stratiform cloud deck will cover much of
the region and model soundings show this cloud deck thickening
through the night as the air beneath the cloud gradually moistens
with more precipitation eventually reaching the ground. Currently,
guidance suggests the western flanks of the main axis of moisture
transport Friday night into Saturday morning may extend into the I-
35 corridor and the Hill Country where overnight temperatures are
currently forecast to bottom out around 28 to 33 degrees. Thus, the
rate of this low-level moistening will be pivotal in determining
